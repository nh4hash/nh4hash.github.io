<p>A well-marked run with a mixture of road, alleys and slippery grassland. Few checks but deliberate (honestly!) lack of markings at junctions mostly kept the pack together. We were joined by occasional NH4 visitors Machinist, Annie and Headley Hound. The last time we ran from Bartons Mill was in May 2016.</p>

<p>After a confusing start we eventually exited the car park to the left to cross a slippery meadow and tour the housing area and wooded paths of Little Basing. Then back across the River Loddon to cross under the main line from Basingstoke to Woking in Old Basing, with the second regroup in front of Grange Farm‚Äôs enormous Great Barn. This stored the wheat and barley for Basing House in Tudor times.</p>

<p>We returned under the railway to the on inn to sip a few beers and satisfy hungers under the canopy and heaters of Bartons Mill.</p>

<p><strong>Action Man</strong> HOW DID WE GET OVER THE RAILWAY LINE? NICE TRAIL. CHECKED OUT THE TRAIL FROM START, OH ITS NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY THEY SAID.</p>

<p><strong>Ever Ready</strong> Nice trail, bit fast but very enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>Hanging About</strong> Nice trail. In a not much used area. Around the castle without realising.</p>

<p><strong>Little Prick</strong> That was a runner‚Äôs run. But fun!</p>

<p><strong>No Entry</strong> An exciting and interesting tour of Basingstoke</p>

<p><strong>Headley Hound</strong> Thanks ‚Äì short but sweet trail.</p>

<p><strong>Petal</strong> A truly excellent run. Very good!</p>
