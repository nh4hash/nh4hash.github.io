<p>A good attendance at the 2222 celebratory run. The new t-shirts recording the day handed out
before the circle. A new song, written by Hash Songster was predictably mangled by the hash choir,
despite being led by Ever Ready and Primate. Fortunately, or not so, Little Prick was not in
attendance to hear it due to Fun Size getting the dreaded virus.</p>

<p>The pack finally headed off into Holt Pound Inclosure, before crossing the railway and following the
River Wey for a while. Some tricky trail laying by the hares sent the frb‚Äôs into the distance the wrong
way while the pack crossed back into the forest over Shipwrights Way and into Lodge Inclosure. The
route then passed through Alice Holt Research Station and behind Birdworld back to the start. A very
enjoyable trail.</p>

<p>An extensive buffet was provided at the pub which although huge was predicably demolished in
short shrift by the hash before down downs. There was also a tasty birthday cake for Headplant.</p>

<h3 id="down-downs-went-to">Down downs went to:</h3>

<p><strong>Hare</strong></p>

<p><strong>Commercial Whale</strong> Because he couldn‚Äôt find his way out of the car park</p>

<p><strong>Velcro Female</strong> She had done the trail before but didn‚Äôt recognise it!</p>

<p><strong>Ever Ready and Primate</strong> Songsters leading the ‚Äòchoir‚Äô‚Ä¶.They had to sing it again (not much better even after practice)</p>

<p><strong>Headplant</strong> Received a Hashy Birthday.</p>
