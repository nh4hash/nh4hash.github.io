<p>The run started in cloudy weather but quickly improved with blue skies and sun. Having started in one industrial estate the runners soon moved to another past an irate local telling us the trail was on private property. All got through except Seis Matters and Ever Ready¬† who were not seen again.</p>

<p>The trail then followed the course of the old Meon Valley before turning east towards Newtown Valence and a regroup on a hillside with amazing views as long as you didn‚Äôt look behind and see the monstrous electricity pylon.</p>

<p>Across more fields northwards towards Upper Farringdon then west back to the CP.</p>

<p>The scribe ran 6.66 miles so a little longer run than recent trails but everyone appeared to enjoy it or at least were pleased to be back.</p>

<p>Already back were Ever Ready and Seis Matters and Squiffy was also in the car park apparently late because his car was only running on four cylinders.</p>

<h3 id="down-downs-went-to">Down downs went to:</h3>

<p><strong>Silvier</strong> as hare</p>

<p><strong>Yellow Peril</strong> for praising the run to the hare when we were only halfway round; or, according to YP himself ‚Äúfor finding beauty in the pylons and crackling 
power lines (or something)‚Äù.</p>

<p><strong>JGG</strong> and Hanging About, as JGG had suggested that if he collapsed the hash would carry him back. HA was seen disappearing into the distance to avoid the possible effort.</p>

<p><strong>Dickhead</strong> for warning everyone go duck as the moon was low.</p>

<p><strong>Seis Matters</strong> for getting lost so close to his home.</p>

<h3 id="a-selection-of-comments">A selection of comments:</h3>

<p><strong>Silvier Fox</strong> That was a pleasure ‚Äì New area and a docile pack.</p>

<p><strong>Seis Matters</strong> Excellent ‚Äì at least the two miles that I ran backwards.</p>

<p><strong>Squiffy</strong> Running on 3 cylinders</p>

<p><strong>Dickhead</strong> SOME OLD ‚Äì SOME NEW. THE SUN SHONE, THE BEERS GOOD ‚Äì WOT‚ÄôS NOT TO LIKE!</p>

<p><strong>‚ÄòEr Indoors</strong> Another jousewatching stroll ‚Äì very nice</p>

<p><strong>Hobble</strong> VERY VERY SHORT SHORT CUT. GOT A BAD BACK</p>
