<p>23 scurvy pirates assembled in Potters car park, some assisted by Yellow Peril handing out newspaper pirate hats, to celebrate “National Talk Like a Pirate Day” which is every September 19th since 1995.</p>

<p>The cap’n of the hares, No Entry, introduced his fellow shitp mates and we set off across the road into the woods. The weather held fair but there were some steep waves on the run.</p>

<p>Mountain Rescue had to be towed in by Fuggles with a bad hip.</p>

<p>Back by the calm waters of the canal Down-downs were handed out by OT to:</p>

<p>The Pirates who set the run,</p>

<p><strong>Captain Shrinky Dink</strong> The ups and downs were like a force 6 off Finisterre.</p>

<p><strong>The fettishists: JGG</strong> with plastic thigh boots (needed suspenders) &amp; Yorkie for fantasising about them.</p>

<p><strong>Velcro</strong> Insulted the RA. Needs another eye patch (mistook JGG for OT)</p>

<p><strong>Yellow Peril</strong> had to retell a terrible joke: “ . . . the pirates from Penn’s Aunts”
Then YP handed Fun Size &amp; Flash the key to his uncle’s treasure chest. They opened the box and shared various treasures, each wrapped in white tissue paper.</p>
