    <h4 class="page-title__subtitle">Old Thumper and JGG<br/>Tarn car park, Littleworth Road<br/>Golden Fleece, Elstead. NB – unfortunately, no Thai food this time, as they are stopping serving early – sorry!</h4>
</p>
</div>

<p>A remarkable turnout for August and predicted intense heat of the day. It was good
to see Lady Chatterley and Three and Fourpence attend and also Nettles and Flying
Doctor who have been missed. </p>

<p>A great trail laid by the hares and they managed to arrange for light cloud cover to
take the edge off the suns heat. As belt and braces the hares also laid the trail
primarily in the woods to keep us in the shade.</p>

<p>Starting off from the South car park the route took us down to the Tarn and everyone
thought we would go round the lake and up onto Puttenham common, but with a
clever switch back we headed south and west across Lower Puttenham Common
and then to Britty Wood. A fast trail with some sections for the frb’s that I suspect the short cutters avoided, plus a long drag uphill in soft sand!</p>

<p>We were all pleased to get back to the car park and after down downs on to the
Golden Fleece for a few drinks. Although being told food was unfortunately off, a
couple of nameless individuals managed to sneak off early and order a nice Thai
curry before the kitchen closed.</p>
