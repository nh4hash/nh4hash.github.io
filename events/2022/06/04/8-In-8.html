<p>Portia has sent the proposed itinerary for the third Hampshire 8 hashes in eight days. See the letter attached.</p>

<p>NH4 are down to do the first one on Sunday 3rd July.</p>

<p>I did the arrangements last time using the Pyestock Club and I am happy to arrange at the same location again if if it is still available. However, if any other members wish to use another location and are prepared to organise accordingly I am happy to hand it over to them. The club provided burgers, chips and drinks after the run. We had about 70 people.</p>
