We’re really excited about having an AH3 RE-BOOT with a pop-up run on Friday 6th May 2022 setting off at 6pm and hope you’ll be joining us again.
Yorkie’s trail-blazing with a scorcher from [Bourley Road (middle car park)](https://maps.google.com/maps?&z=10&q=51.2512283325195+,-0.792232275009155&ll=51.2512283325195+-0.792232275009155){:target="_blank"} on **Friday 6th May 2022 setting off at 6pm** - These occasional Friday-nighters were a great success during lock-down and we’re really looking forward to re-booting them and looking forward to seeing you there in 2 weeks time.
