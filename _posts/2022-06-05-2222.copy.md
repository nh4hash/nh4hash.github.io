As mentioned in the circle last night (in the rain!!) we are looking to produce a t-shirt to celebrate the 2,222 run of NH4 on Sunday 26th June 2022.

If you would like to order a t-shirt could you let us know the size you want.

Cost is likely to be about Â£12-14, possibly plus VAT (to be confirmed).

Please respond by 8pm Thursday 9th June.
