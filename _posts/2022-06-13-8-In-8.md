Hi everyone,

Please see the list of venues for the 8 in 8 attached. I note that the last one by Wessex H3 is not in Hampshire and is a long way from us. Not sure why that is.

Start times and further info hopefully to follow soon. As a guide last time the Monday to Friday runs I believe started at 7pm, and the weekends ones at 11am.

On on
