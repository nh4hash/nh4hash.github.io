‘Er Indoors & Hobble stepped in at the last minute to set this run when No Entry had to call in sick. An unfamiliar route over familiar but slippery territory, mostly woodlands with only the odd hill. Silvier Fox shot off on the in trail from the start and had to be called back.  Down-downs by the roadside included Dodo for going for an MRI scan of her liver the day after returning from a boozy week in Lanzarote celebrating Firework’s 60th. On Inn for a roast at the Monkey Puzzle - who queried the booking.

__Commercial Whale__ NICE WALK. WELL DONE THE HARES FOR STEPPING IN.

__Ever Ready__ Well done!! Lots of shiggy and even a bit of rain!! New look at an old area.

__Hobble__ PUB WAS BOOKED. HONEST. LANDLADYS FAULT. WORKED OUT IN THE END.

__Jolly Green Giant__ Excellent run at short notice. The FRB seem to be diminishing as the run went on. Only 4 at the end.
