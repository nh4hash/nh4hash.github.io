An ingenious & squiggly trail set in sawdust, flour, blue chalk and, for the walkers, white chalk. First up to Hogmoor Inclosure Natural Play Area, then back to Whitehill to cross the A325 to make use of some woodlands to the south and west of Whitehill and back across the A325 to a welcome of chocolate nibbles in the car park from Fun Size and his little friend Reuben. Just as the drizzle started.

__Hippo__ GREAT BACK TO FRONT TRAIL. LUCKY WITH THE WEATHER.

__Hanging About__ Excellent trail. 5.6 miles ran and apparently we missed a loop!
