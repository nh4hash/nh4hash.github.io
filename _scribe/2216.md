Set in the rain & run in the dry - but some big puddles. Walkers had choice of 3km & 4km trails. One regroup, where walkers met runners, with a chance to examine some tank tracks. Down downs included Birthday Boy Sex Slave and 2 for hare Dodo - the second for trying to match her new polo shirt colour to her yacht canvas. And Cuddles while modelling the pink fleece originally embroidered with "Hippo"!
On Inn was the Wagon and Horses.
