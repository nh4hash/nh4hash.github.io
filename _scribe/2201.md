While the NH4 ‘B’ Team were basking on beach chairs and lounging in Lanzarote on a somewhat spurious weekend away, the NH4 ‘A’ Team sped around a well-attended Yellow Peril trail this week from Sandy Lane, Frensham.

4½ miles of mud, shiggy, some ponds and excellent views; sand, hills, pine trees, sunny intervals, twists, turns, sneaky gratuitous peripheral vision turnings, a spot of off-piste, a confused Silvier and a mud-spattered Little Prick, the run saw the runners all back at base in 1hr 17mins. 

No Entry kicked out a check to discover the blob was a dog turd. Silvier and Nettles clocked up a run just shy of 7 miles (where were you Hanging About??!!).

The walkers, meanwhile, were challenged to a 2-mile Out and Back trail to the high peaks of the Devil’s Jumps and returned soon after the runners.

On Inn was the Golden Fleece for a tasty Thai and a tankard of Tribute.

All in all, another successful NH4 event.

PS My apologies, I can’t remember all the Down Down’s (James kindly officiated); Silvier and Nettles were awarded DDs for Long cutting and Mountain Rescue for re-arranging the only signpost on Sandy Lane ….

The Hare got the usual ‘RUBBISH’ for what did we think of the run DD etc?
