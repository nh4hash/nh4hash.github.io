run: 2240

A 50 minute run to ensure we got back in time for the AGM. The weather poured down on the hares in the morning but stopped and the sun came out just in time for the run. Thank you RA. A bit noisy when we ran near the stock car race track.

The new AGM location of the Royal British Legion in Farnborough put on a tasty and more than adequate cold buffet.

This was followed by unusually non-controversial committee reports and elections, in which nearly everyone held on to their current posts. The notable exception being Fairy Snow who didnâ€™t object strongly enough and was therefore elected(?) as our new GM.

For a full report of proceedings see the minutes.
