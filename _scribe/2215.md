A joint run in Farnham after the SH3 May Ball. Seems to have been enjoyed by the small number of NH4 that turned up (15 including known associates).

### A selection of comments:

__Cloggs__ Fab trail, great crowd & circle!

__Ever Ready__ Great run, good weather and entertaining (!) down downs. Thanks Surrey!

__Hanging About__ Great weather. Not many checks, but still ran a lot of false trails

__Prime8__ Long haul uphill for starters, home + dry eventually.
