A run of 2 halves; past the castle and round Farnham Park, then, just as we thought we had seen all the back alleys on a circumnavigation of Farnham, we ran out of town along Red Lion Lane to cross footbridges over the A31 bypass and the railway. Through the streets of Wrecclesham, where a house decorated with Christmas lights in aid of Phyllis Tuckwell had put the lights on specially for us (text TWINKLE to 70300 to donate £5). The hares included enough tricks to keep the pack together well. 

Then back, under the railway and along a slippery path by the River Wey, to dodge the traffic on the dual carriageway, and return across Bishop’s Meadow. Closing in on the car park after an hour and 25 minutes (& 8.2 km for me) we overtook the walkers whinging about how long the walk was.

Finally back to the Hares’ gaff for down downs, a song & sparklers, and eating soup & sausages in rolls, while warming ourselves with gluhwein and a fire pit tended by Hobble.
