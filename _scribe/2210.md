A lovely sunny day in an ideal hashing area – forest tracks with some ups and downs but not enough to complain about. So ideal in fact that 2 other hashes were laid here today: Surrey, (we encountered their walkers) and Pistoffen. Consequently YP used a special "4" mark in places to distinguish our marks (see photo). All our checks were 1-blob only and only one regroup so rather fast for me. But thanks for marking the trail so well for me, YP, and going back to look for me. Ever Ready gracefully tripped over in front of me (see photo).

### Down downs went to:

 __hare__

 __Hanging About__ for terrible language in front of a child (using the "S" word)

 __Shrinky Dink__ for consorting with S….. hashers 

 __Prime 8, Cuddles & Sex Slave__ (forgotten why)

 __Little Prick__ for spilling her jelly babies on the ground
