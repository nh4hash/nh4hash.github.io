A very good turn-out (32) for a damp and shiggy first hash of the year, but the rain kept off until we’d consumed most of Shrinky Dink and Dodo’s New Year party left-overs and the remains of Yellow Peril’s mince pies after the run.

After a long absence we welcomed back Simon Scolding and James Acott, with his son William, who was one of the Down Down recipients.
