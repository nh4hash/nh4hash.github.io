run: 2236

The hangover run of the Swanage away weekend, although most of us are too old to stay up late and get a hangover nowadays.

Two distinct trails: a run and a walk, with some walkers even going shopping after the 1st check, I understand. 
Run was good - I kept up! Pleasant countryside and OK built up area at start and finishing past Swanage station just as a steam train came out. Thankfully did not live up to the hare’s mention of a 7 mile recce the day before!

### Down downs went to:

The Hares of course.

__The Hearing Aids__ Hanging About for hearing Bullets instead of Bollocks and Hobble for getting ‘Er Indoors “a small wine” instead of “one more wine”.

__Nettles__  “Artificial Aids”:  for getting his smart phone map out so early in the run.

__OT__ then thanked the organisers for another brilliant weekend.

We finished the day with an Indian meal together, followed, by some of us, with Sex on the Beach. I ended the evening with a Sandy Crack.

### From the Tick Sheet:

__‘Er Indoors__ Sunny walk up the other[?] hill looking down at Swanage :) Thanks hares x
