Another, even warmer, sunny day for NH4's 41st anniversary. An innovative trail over familiar territory. Somewhat hilly, canal, lots of trees, avoidable shiggy.
Followed by chocolate refrigerator birthday cake by Flying Doctor & down downs to:

### Down downs went to:

__The hares__ of course

__Firework & Charmaine Chardonnay__ welcome back after over 2 years non-appearance

__Shrinky Dink & Yellow Peril__ exemplary hashing and something else

__Yorkie__ visionary hearing â€“ thinks he heard Silvier calling

__No Entry, Yellow Peril (again) & Hobble__ Innuendos - Not hard, difficulty getting leg over, original member

### A selection of comments:

__Charmaine Chardonnay__ Lovely to be back, Lovely weather, Lovly peoples, lovely cake. Lovely day

__Firework__ 1st back after 2.25 years!! NOT A THING HAS CHANGED

__Mountain Rescue__ Great walk with Hippo on a short cut that was longer than laid

__Old Thumper__ Lovely wriggly trail in the sun!

And then a naming of a virgin hasher: Fifi was named Hash Hobbit.

Followed by a lazy Indian lunch in the sunshine in the back yard of the Miners Arms.
