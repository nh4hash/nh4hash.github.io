A well-marked run with a mixture of road, alleys and slippery grassland. Few checks but deliberate (honestly!) lack of markings at junctions mostly kept the pack together. We were joined by occasional NH4 visitors Machinist, Annie and Headley Hound. The last time we ran from Bartons Mill was in May 2016. 

After a confusing start we eventually exited the car park to the left to cross a slippery meadow and tour the housing area and wooded paths of Little Basing. Then back across the River Loddon to cross under the main line from Basingstoke to Woking in Old Basing, with the second regroup in front of Grange Farm’s enormous Great Barn. This stored the wheat and barley for Basing House in Tudor times.

We returned under the railway to the on inn to sip a few beers and satisfy hungers under the canopy and heaters of Bartons Mill.
