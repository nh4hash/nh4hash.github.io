Another masterly run set by Yorkie – 'hot-laid'. The first evening run this year. Yorkie arrived back just as we were assembling in the circle. His instructions went something like: "It's that way". The runners pack kept together but a bit fast for me so I joined some of the walkers half way round. A new route round familiar territory.

### Down downs went to:

__Drought breaker hare__ (found a bit of shiggy)

__Birthday boy Prime8__ who bought cases of beer to distribute

__No Entry__ who came direct from scouts, dropped his trousers and showed his oddballs

__Goofy__ who had returned

__Sex Slave & Cuddles__ for opening and following the "EMERGENCY" map from the start
