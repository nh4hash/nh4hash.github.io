A short run out of the housing estate before passing the pub and entering Brentmoor Heath. A regroup at an information board in front of a gorse bush, then on via shiggy and more shiggy. Dickhead and JGG left lasting craters in the mud to quickly fill with water. Balancing on logs over the shiggy a bit of a challenge for the majority of hashers!

Nice big houses on the walk.
