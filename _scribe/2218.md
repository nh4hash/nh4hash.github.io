A good attempt. Running trail criss-crossed walkers trail to start with, keeping both groups close together. A bit tight and confusing in places as trail could be seen beyond a bar but shouted instructions from the hare kept us on the straight and narrow (or rather the very twisty and narrow). Home stretch for walkers and runners was long and straight along the canal tow-path.
