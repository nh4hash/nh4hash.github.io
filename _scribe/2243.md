run: 2243

GM Fairy Snow called half the pack together at 1 minute to 11 to lead us in 2 minutes silence. The rebellious half of the pack gathered in the Bagshot Playing Fields entrance a few yards up the road.

It was primarily a woodland, leaf-strewn, run, rather long, exceptionally mild and enjoyable. A better than average turn-out at 28, including Hash Hobbit.

## Down Downs

-   The Hares, for taking us to Cobblers’ Hole
-   Visitor Bolshy Bastard for tastelessness
-   Cloggs - “Don’t tell the RA - Oh shit you are the RA”
-   Velcro - “Where’s the RA when you need IT”
And - would have been forgotten but she was handing out delicious sugar-laden home-made cakes 
- Little Prick for her birthday
- No Entry who missed a down-down the previous week.
