run: 2244
---

For this run we welcomed the visiting Danes (Mette, Christian and girlfriend Julie) and visitors/returnees Big Moaney Richard Corser and son Marcus).

A bright, sunshine day after loads of rain made this a pleasant but slippy-slidy run. After a short while we arrived outside The Selborne Arms, only to continue down the Selborne Road and left into Gracious Street. Then a variety of vistas over fields, and lots of up and down hills through woodlands.

## Down Downs

-   The Hares
-   Velcro for theoretical hashing
-   Petal for her dog’s pointing & Yellow Peril for something related.
-   The Danes
-   And Seis Matters (again) for his 400th run (last week) with NH4

The pack then retired to the Railway Arms for welcome refreshment.

## Some comments:

__Dodo__			excellent skating! well done hares

__Hanging About__	Enjoyable trail. Great views, devious back checks and plenty of shiggy.

__Silvier Fox__		Great running trail. Had to leap over a hedge to avoid a charging horse. Fifi thought it was a game.

__Legover__			Good to be back. The hash never disapoints!

__Jolly Green Giant__ Went on the walk. Nice to see different parts.

__‘Er Indoors__		Lovely views in the sunshine. Thanks Hares for great directions :)
