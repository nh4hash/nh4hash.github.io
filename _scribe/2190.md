A 1 km walk on an icy but dry, bright, autumnal morning, alongside the Basingstoke Canal, returning across the old Guildford Road, and through the woods to recross the canal into Frimley Lodge Park. The runners followed this route but with 6 gratuitous loops and a 300 metre check-back which kept the 10 runners together.

Yellow Peril stood in for the RA and dished out copious ice-cold beers before we retired to the Miners’ Arms, where Fuggles was still cold and the landlady offered to take Hobble to bed for sex and let ‘Er Indoors watch.
