A very sunny, shiggy and slippery run up and up and up the hanger area then
more slowly down and down and down to an unexpected and very welcome beer
stop. Followed by cold hot cross buns courtesy of Yellow Peril and a picnic and
table tennis in the car park.

The comments below say it all.

Some comments:

__Action Man__ BRILLIANT SUNNY DAY. LOTS OF SHIGGY UPS AND DOWNS. BRILLIANT TRAIL + VERY NICE BEER STOP AT GILBERT WHITES BREWERY – ON, ON!

__Flying Doctor__ Sunshine, beer, hills, mud, water. All the elements of a fantastic hash

__Hanging About__ A ‘PROPER’ HASH! HAD EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY SHIGGY AND HILLS AND BEER STOP

__Dickhead__ I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS – BUT I WAS GLAD TO SEE SOME TARMAC TO RUN ON! GREAT SHIGGY, THOUGH!

__Old Thumper__	 Great bit of cross-country skiing! 

__Hippo__ Splendid walkers’ trail with a choice of on-inns.

__Little Prick__ What a nice slither. Lovely beer
