The run started in cloudy weather but quickly improved with blue skies and sun. Having started in one industrial estate the runners soon moved to another past an irate local telling us the trail was on private property. All got through except Seis Matters and Ever Ready  who were not seen again.

The trail then followed the course of the old Meon Valley before turning east towards Newtown Valence and a regroup on a hillside with amazing views as long as you didn't look behind and see the monstrous electricity pylon.

Across more fields northwards towards Upper Farringdon then west back to the CP.

The scribe ran 6.66 miles so a little longer run than recent trails but everyone appeared to enjoy it or at least were pleased to be back.

Already back were Ever Ready and Seis Matters and Squiffy was also in the car park apparently late because his car was only running on four cylinders.

### Down downs went to:

__Silvier__ as hare

__Yellow Peril__ for praising the run to the hare when we were only halfway round; or, according to YP himself "for finding beauty in the pylons and crackling 
power lines (or something)".

__JGG__ and Hanging About, as JGG had suggested that if he collapsed the hash would carry him back. HA was seen disappearing into the distance to avoid the possible effort.

__Dickhead__ for warning everyone go duck as the moon was low.

__Seis Matters__ for getting lost so close to his home.

### A selection of comments:


__Silvier Fox__ That was a pleasure – New area and a docile pack.

__Seis Matters__ Excellent – at least the two miles that I ran backwards.

__Squiffy__ Running on 3 cylinders

__Dickhead__ SOME OLD – SOME NEW. THE SUN SHONE, THE BEERS GOOD – WOT'S NOT TO LIKE!

__'Er Indoors__ Another jousewatching stroll – very nice

__Hobble__ VERY VERY SHORT SHORT CUT. GOT A BAD BACK
