A fast run helped us to keep warm on a cool day.

We started from a full car park where the Grand Mistress summed up the weeks news before we set off across the recreation ground. I remember trees and some hills. Mostly cross country but a few bits of road running.

Hanging About ended up a bloody mess, Sanyu got a down-down for observation – noticed that we could short cut down from a hilltop to save a couple of hundred yards – thank you Fuggles.
