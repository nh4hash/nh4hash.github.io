A well prepared and clearly set semi-live run and walk on a mild Boxing Day. Used a different route over familiar territory, in and out of Tweseldown Race Course.

Afterwards we enjoyed sitting and standing around sociably enjoying Xmas left-overs, and mulled wine provided by Yorkie. The RA administered down downs, including yours truly for claiming he was not a boy.
