Fairy Snow and Fuggles drove in through the circle on the stroke of 6 o'clock, as Yellow Peril started to give the hares' briefing in front of Binsted Church, telling of "one or two fast bits, lots of nice fine views, a little bit of shiggy, some ponds, ... 2 regroups, no real short cuts, really, so if you decide you've had enough by about half way round you've had it! ... Blobs in sawdust, markings in flour, a couple of check-backs, or more."

And so we set off over hill and dale, past cricket match and fields of maize and corn stubble, ending as the sun sank towards the horizon and woodland tracks became gloomy.

### Down Downs went to

__The Hares__ for "a load of rubbish"

__Action Man__ for wildlife abuse - swallowing bees

__JGG & No Entry__ for inuendo: "I can get down but I can't get up again" and something about horizontal jogging

__Petal__ Ever Ready being helpful ... sniff of the hare ... fragrance we wouldn't buy

__Flash & Fun__ Size for hand bags - which they denied carrying on the run

__Dirty Rascal__ health and safety nightmare

And so on-inn to The Star to enjoy a drink and write some comments:

__Action Man__ VERY FLAT NAUTICALLY, ACCORDING TO SHRINKY DINK!

__Dodo__ GOOD SHORT RUN - EXCELLENT AFTER 3 MONTHS! [away in Spain]

__Old Thumper__ Lovely recovery meander [from a half marathon in the morning] - good blackberries.

__Hash Hobbit__ Ever Ready trod on my toes! Bastard. And Yorkie kicked me in the bollocks (if I had any I don't now)

__Dirty Rascal__ Bit dark in the forest! Good run!
