__Goofy__ EXERCISE, EDUCATION - WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT? MUCH ENJOYED - THANKS

__Little Prick__ The Orchids made my day!

__No Entry__ Bee orchids! Hooray

__Silvier Fox__ Enjoyed laying this trail. The white Hellebone orchids were past their best sadly but the runners saw Bee orchids in a grass area. Beautiful!

__Dirty Rascal__ Good fun, thanks!

__Hanging About__ Enjoyable trail, needed some tricky navigation. Even orchids!

__Ever Ready__ Nice walk, got a bit lost but that's hashing. Hope to run next week when my chest is better!
