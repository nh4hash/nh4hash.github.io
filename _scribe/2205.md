Run was well laid with blue skies but cold wind. Nice when sheltered from wind, say, behind a hill but generally the runners had to go over them. Given the recent rain it was dry underfoot.

Downdowns to hares… it was noted that in the distant past roles were reversed, with Every Ready now struggling to get around with dodgy knee. DD also to Nettles for demonstrating new highway code rules by running out in front of a fast moving cyclist and forcing him to do a scary emergency stop!

A selection of comments:

__Goofy__ Great trail. Lots of hills and no shiggy – I’ll rectify that next week!

__Hobble__ Loverly walk along the brook. Great corned beef sandwich.

__Jolly Green Giant__ Excellent run with plenty of hills. No camera crew though

__Seis Matters__ Very enjoyable but HILLY.
