### Down downs went to:

__Cuddles__ “Bit too flat!”

__Damp Patch__ “Lovely walk – bit hard”

__Ever Ready__ “Up and down like a toilet seat, but challenging and interesting trail”

__Hanging About__ “Great trail. A lot of gratuitous loops and peripheral visions”

__Sex Slave__ “Great trails of a select bunch”

__Silvier__ “This was a Yorkie/YP toughie. How we didn’t set off army ordnance I don’t know”
