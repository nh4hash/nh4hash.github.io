Fairly long run: new route over familiar territory, enjoyed by all, judging from the comments.

### A selection of comments:

__Cuddles__ Great trail, wish I'd had the stamina to do the whole thing!

__'Er Indoors__ Super walkers trail well marked :)

__Ever Ready__ Great run, lots of variation and just about the right length

__Jolly Green Giant__ Very intricate and lots of hills

__No entry__ Great value for money. Two runs for price of one

__Old Thumper__ Good trail - bit different use of familiar territory

__Silvier Fox__ Fifi ran after her Mum so I had to go into hypodrive to recapture

__Yellow Peril__ Perfect evening for a bit of length (6 1/4 miles!) Great trail
