Yet another warm sunny day. We gathered in Yellow Peril's field, beside a gipsy caravan. Silvier Fox set off before the hare's briefing, to lay eggs at 3 regroups (1 for the walkers and 2 for the runners). 51 eggs in total, I heard. Then a run covering lots of fields and beautiful views.

Followed by a picnic BBQ with sausages, bread and beer courtesy of Yellow Peril, and left-over chocolate refrigerator cake from Flying Doctor. The more energetic/childish played boules.

### Down downs went to:

__Seis__ Matters: for standing up for the walkers, saying they were slow but not thick.

__Dodo__ for wearing her necklace back to front (Od-Od).

__Caboose__ visitor, for matching the olde-world feeling  by arriving by steam train.

__Hobble__ for having more practice pulling

__Fun Size__ The Explosive One
