Hanging About turned up looking like a Ukrainian flag for a lovely, longish run in the sunshine. Soon we were passing along Ham Lane with its posh houses with nice names and well-tended gardens. Then we ran behind the goal on Burford Lodge Recreation Ground and into Weyburn Meadows where 2 fish-hooks (one spontaneous) were encountered to slow down the front runners.

A photo-call with most of the walkers at the southern-most point, then back, eventually, crossing Thursley Road Recreation Ground. Thanks to the hares, who provided just enough short cuts to enable Petal & me to keep up. The walkers got back about the same time as the runners, so a well-timed and well executed hash.

A neat circle on The Green, then On-Inn to the Golden Fleece for a tasty Thai meal.

Down downs went to the hares (of course), Fun Size for something I didn’t hear and Yellow Peril, the Hallucinator, for praising things of beauty(?).
