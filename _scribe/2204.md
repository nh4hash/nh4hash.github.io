Dickhead set a wonderful run in cool, sunny weather through beautiful heathland and woodland paths, circumnavigating the wetter areas. 

Dodo & I turned up 15 minutes late, due to some nasty Russian allegedly messing around with the satnav signals and sending us all over the county. In a futile attempt to catch up with the pack I short cut across the squishy, bouncy, wet, bogland, shin-deep in water, only proving that my water proof socks hold water in as well as out. Finding the in trail I got back ahead of the runners; Squiffy, who arrived in his car only a minute or so late (nothing new there), at least did the whole trail but finished 25 minutes after the down-downs.

Dodo, amongst others, got a down-down for blaming the current political situation for our late-coming [thanks for not blaming me, Dodo]

Hanging About was accused of treading on someone small, or something like that, but got a down-down for something else, I forget what.
