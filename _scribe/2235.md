run: 2235

The first run of this year's weekend away in Swanage, this year staying at The Castleton b&b, conveniently situated opposite the Crows Nest. Excellent breakfast and friendly staff.

The usual steam train ride from Swanage via Harmans Cross to Corfe Castle with fares collected by JGG. 

The weather was kind to us so we sat in The Castle garden for lunch, beverages and down-downs, till it was time for some of us to assemble at the bus stop for the trip back to Swanage.
