https://www.woodlarkpub.co.uk/","The coffee was non-descript instant, the chips were excellent (my choice) and the club sandwich looked very good indeed (Yorkie’s choice).

We’ve booked space for 20 people at 12.45 in the bar in our own ‘area’ to the right after the entrance into the pub where hashers can order food.

Good choice of ale the day we visited too.
