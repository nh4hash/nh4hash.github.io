    <span lang="EN-GB">For reasons of state security, or perhaps health and 
    safety, I am not allowed to disclose the venue for this, NH4's first run of 
    2010. Surprisingly, it was not in the ancient county of Southampton, but 
    somewhere in S*****. We seemed to have got away with it, because none of&nbsp; 
    the locals turned up. However, one hasher arrived from the frozen North in 
    the shape of Wally from Berks.. [It was frozen in all directions]. SEX SLAVE 
    welcomed Wally with open arms, actually closed fists, in the most animated 
    manner yet seen from him. However, I digress.....</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">The chosen car park proved to be much too small to 
    accommodate all the pack's cars (not to mention the odd dog walker who 
    cheekily descended there, at one point one asked&nbsp; Alan to move his car, 
    which he did, by which time she had found somewhere else. I directed two 
    cars to rather obscure corners of said car park, thereby doing my good deed 
    for this year and covering next year as well, but extremely late latecomers 
    had to park on the snow covered verge.</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">The trail led out of the car park, parallel to the road 
    and was followed initially by the entire pack with the exception of Wally, 
    presumably trying to avoid another attack from SEX SLAVE. Then out of the 
    wooded area onto the heath, criss-crossed by snowy paths. Some blobs of 
    flour could be discerned amid the snow, and the pack stayed together pretty 
    well (short cut advised for yours truly). Part of the trail was defended by 
    a dog that jumped up at all hashers regardless of shouts of 'Down Down' from 
    its owner. Both dog and hounds realised that she didn't mean it.</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">Back into a wooded area, we pressed on swiftly (well it 
    was cold) and arrived at another regroup by a road, where the pack turned 
    right, and then left, crossing the road. MOUNTAIN RESCUE was taking 
    rearguard action at this point, but cunningly led the vanguard after a 
    strategically placed check. The trail circumnavigated (good word that) a big 
    field to appear back at the road, where I awaited (another advised short 
    cut, refused by FRUITN'NUT, cos too tired). A short walk led back over the 
    railway, past(!) <i>the Jolly Farmer</i> to a regroup in their car park, 
    overseen by a tethered horse.</span></p>

    wearing sun cream. The large turnout was eager to get underway and, after a 
    spirited skating demonstration in the car park by HORN and FRUIT AND NUT we 
    set off up a long, gradual incline. Once we reached the Selbourne snow line 
    we ran into a wolf like creature dragging behind it an exhausted and wrecked 
    HAAGEN DASH. Putting this horrific sight behind us we continued through the 
    snow and mud along the bottom of the hangar. Over a stile, across a field 
    and back into town, giving the impression that the run really was short but 
    No, we crossed the road and made off into a very damp meadow. SILVIER FOX 
    missed the check (well marked in sawdust coloured sawdust) and visited the 
    church whilst the pack splashed up hill, eventually re-crossing the road and 
    meeting the knitting circle (well directed by deputy Hare JANET+JOHN). The 
    groups separated, the knitters retracing their steps while the FRB's (and 
    the rest) started up hill again, taking the hangar in the rear (well side,

    and interesting, with lots of shiggy, snow and several unexpected rivers 
    (Probably snow melting off the Alps?). It was noticeable that the pack kept 
    close throughout the run, possibly because of the cold and because the wolf 
    still appeared from time to time. The main problem was ice, which ensured 
    that for every three steps forward you went backwards one, thus leaving the

    started making early excuses about flour mysteriously disappearing on the

    had fallen down a manhole in the night (!). Then, to cap it all, NO ENTRY

    SCHOONER at once repeated his disgraceful behaviour of last week with 
    another dog but HAGEN DASH managed to pull him away. The next mile or so was 
    like something from a horror film with lost people desperately trying to 
    find their way out of menacing woods and finding no guidance. At last, a 
    rudimentary bridge appeared in the Mytchet Keys and we were off again. 
    Following the right bank of the canal (the left bank is always too exciting 
    and left wing for many hashers) we ended up on a hill overlooking the fair 
    city of Farnborough. Whilst enjoying the wonderful view of Queensmead, the 
    Council Recycling Centre and the Clockhouse roundabout, VELCRO had a sudden 
    visitation and clapped two pink appendages to her ears, presumably to get in 
    contact with a passing UFO.</span></p>

    wooden bridges, hanging fronds, narrow valleys with steep stairways and lots 
    of Grade 1 shiggy. Torvil and Dean where are you when you are wanted? In 
    fact, so deep was the shiggy and so heavy going were the fields that the 
    build up on running shoes obviated the need for flour as everyone grew at 
    least three feet and could see the trail over the trees. Things weren't 
    helped by HAAGEN DASH who, ignoring SCHOONER'S advice ran off at ninety 
    degrees to the trail. Throughout these&nbsp; tribulations we were fully protected

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">In 
    November and December, we endured an undiluted diet of torrential rain. 
    After the Copenhagen Global Warning Conference, the worst winter since 
    records began began and it's still with us. The threat of climate change has 
    prompted the Basingstoke Town Counselors to make a bid for the 2014 Winter 
    Olympics since Sochi in Russia will by then have become an arid desert 
    (shortly after Vancouver).</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
    Today was exceptional in that ice, the remains of snow, torrential rain 
    (fortunately not during the hash), flooded roads and shiggy tracks were ALL 
    present at once. In short, a classic British winter hash and it can only be 
    a matter of time before we gain our Olympic status. We would get a gold for 
    sure by following that old formula of the Empire:- Invent a sport with 
    unintelligible rules, introduce it to the colonies, thrash them at every 
    competition and then move on as soon as they've practiced enough to thrash 
    us back. (Cricketers take note please!)</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">A 
    cunning and inventive trail lead us around and within ricochet's reach of a 
    small war. Since I had not expected to write today's account I gave my 
    neurons a rest to divert energy to the running bits of my body. This is 
    usually thighs, legs and feet, however, in the latter stages of the hash, 
    the feet as far as I could tell were no longer present. I was not alone in 
    this judging by the duck-like jogging style of the FRB's, except for 
    Mountain Rescue who, with the typical foresight and planning of a 
    military man, wore heated bootees under his hashing gear, a military secret 
    recently released along with the revelations of UFO sightings. Talking of 
    which, did you see Fruit'n Nut's BBC girlfriend commentating on the 
    Olympics. With those sort of contacts we're in there for sure. Roll on 2014 
    and let's go for gold. Not necessarily the medal but at least Thraplewold's 
    Old Gold Bitter, shortly to feature at the Selborne Arms.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">At 
    75 minutes for the FRB's, the hash was, indeed, an excellent way to gain the 
    moral high ground before descending back into the decadent morass from 
    whence we rose. Talking of morasses - back to the hash. There were some 
    cunning check-backs that reversed the pack very effectively. Stirring up 
    those neurons I now remember passing an aged hasher using ski poles. Yes! 
    Practicing for 2014 already; what a hero! As for Mary, you've all heard it 
    before, &quot;I'll take it easy today since I've got Achilles tendon, Ulysses 
    groin, Jupiter's do-dahs&quot; and all the rest. For the first time in history, 
    he did actually walk. Even Nettles was below par, although, with 2014 in the 
    offing, you have to pace yourself. You don't want to peak too early. </p>

    Down-downs were justifiably awarded to Horn and Hippo for an excellent 
    shiggy run, Mountain Rescue for crimes already mentioned, Dickhead for Steer 
    Wrestling, Old Thumper and somebody else (the Directors is getting to the 
    neurons again) for insulting the RA. Was it Denise (of 'Denise is connected 
    to the thigh bone' fame)? I can't remember but it doesn't matter. It was a 
    good day out with North Hants Hash yet again.</p>

    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">The 
    Hare had said that there were only 8 parking spaces at the pub; at one stage 
    it looked as though that was going to be 6 too many, but eventually a good 
    pack turned up dressed in Sou'Westers and galoshes. The start was next to a 
    canal, but it could equally have been a road, such was the flooding.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">So, off 
    we went after the usual words from the hares and greetings to a plethora of 
    visitors from the Haslemere Hash. Wet Bush was to take the walkers; she 
    certainly wouldn't have any problems finding many of her namesake! So, up 
    over the canal bridge and onto the flooded paths. Water and mud was to be 
    the ongoing theme, it was one of those runs you'd like to do again in the 
    Summer as it was very scenic as the trail criss-crossed the Wey and canal. 
    Mind you with the summers we get at the moment, it would still be flooded! 
    Occasionally, there was a bit of road, which caused Haagen-Dash's right arm 
    to stretch as he tried to hold back a rampant Schooner; nothing worked, 
    including shouting at him. Perhaps he needs an English to Dog interpreter. 
    Strangely, a small black dog owned by one of the visitors spent a lot of 
    time chasing Schooner, not at all put off by the disparity in size. 
    Schooners just a pussy cat, really!</span></p>

    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">There 
    were quite a few plank bridges to cross, some of which were very green and 
    slippery. D.Head took these very gingerly as he had already fallen heavily 
    at the pub on the wooden decking before the run started! &nbsp;One part of the 
    trail seemed to weave in and around trees in a copse in a completely random 
    order, rather than in a straight line; this had the hand of Yorkie written 
    all over it!</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">Onward 
    we went, splashing around a particularly flooded path where I followed JGG 
    because he said that's the way the trail goes. Nobody else went that way 
    because it was knee deep in muck and bullets. How Horn did laugh!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;">Further 
    on, loomed a very steep, narrow bridge over the canal that Kerb Crawler 
    cautioned that the steps were very steep and slippy on the far side. &nbsp;Hmm, 
    with my shoes perhaps I should swim across. Steps safely negotiated, the 
    trail led into town:&nbsp; it wasn't meant to, but some of us got lost, including 
    Kerb Crawler the co-Hare! However, Yorkie was spotted frantically waving, so 
    we followed back along the tow path and home. It had stopped raining!</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">This hash started on the wrong foot 
    when FRUIT'n NUT and EVEREADY were laying the trail. After an early start we 
    came across two majors and a number of squaddies around a field kitchen but, 
    in spite of FRUIT'n NUT's obvious rapport with them they didn't even offer 
    us a bacon sarnie. Never mind, the weather was positively summer like and we 
    had a good turn out. An early incident almost saw WALLY run down by NO ENTRY 
    twice, an occurrence that many hashers from all over the country would have 
    paid good money to see had it been successful.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">The pack assembled to the chinking 
    of halliards (I think that's what it was) on the masts of&nbsp; boats drawn up on 
    the hard near our car park. &nbsp;Having welcomed those present (including 
    Wally!) the RA let the hares loose to explain the trail, the most important 
    feature being the location of the ON-INN, (The Bumble Bee) miles away 
    because the nearby ones were committed to maternal celebrations.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">The pack set off past an intriguing 
    notice reading 'UOT Command Task' which is believed to be an unnecessary 
    encouragement to Wally. &nbsp;We soon left the shelter of the trees, turning left 
    on to a track exposed to the wind which shivered me timbers. Fortunately 
    there was a stack of timber to hide behind along part of the trail, but it 
    would have been more comfortable if the foresters had left the trees 
    standing. Most of the pack followed a loop around these clearings, but 
    FLYING DOCTOR who was grounded for the day, and PRIMATE, who is now 
    terrified of keeping the pack waiting, managed to avoid looping.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">The going was firm. Even the detour 
    through serious shiggy was disappointing as most of it had dried up. This 
    was proving to be a very uneventful run, through good terrain and in the 
    warm sun. HAGGEN DASH took over the mantle from SCHOONER and was seen to be 
    a little too welcoming to one of our hash virgins, so much so that he ran 
    straight through a regroup. In similar vein, CLOGS was heard to explain that 
    it took her 20 minutes to get into her wet suit. An offer from a certain 
    male hasher to beat that time by a significant margin was graciously 
    declined. As we continued through woods and vales the only irritant was a 
    certain WALLY who seemed to have a moan at almost everything. Truly was ever 
    a man more aptly named?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">We wandered on through paths broad 
    (very, and sandy) and narrow, meeting cyclists and others, walking their 
    dogs, and or children. One group doing both were astonished, and no doubt 
    annoyed, by SCHOONER &nbsp;taking a fancy to their dog (mercifully he left the 
    screaming children alone, and HAAGEN_DASH managed to restrain the offender 
    pretty quickly).</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB">After a depressing example of the 
    group intelligence of the hash, as it ran through at least three, very clear 
    bars and confused the hell out of the new girls, we came to a regroup that 
    was specifically chosen for two reasons: to calm the minds of hashers as 
    they looked over the lake and to give FLYING DOCTOR the opportunity to swim 
    back. Unfortunately she declined this fine offer, but we met the best shiggy 
    of the trail on the short trek back to the car park, where the RA called a 
    somewhat depleted pack into the circle, for the usual abuse and rewards to:</span></p>

    arrived (to protect Wally?), and by coincidence the knitting circle

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The car park 
    was packed full for this run, the crowding largely due to WCs, as some NH4 
    absentees were involved with the Fleet half marathon. This seemed to be a 
    young and old event, with WCs providing the younger element. One 
    particularly small lad came with a large horn with which he&nbsp; managed to 
    out-do HORN. &nbsp;The pack was photographed from the front by Wally (something 
    useful for NH4, a first) and the back, for those who failed to turn round, 
    by a harriette &nbsp;from WCH3.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">After some 
    instructions regarding a measured mile and various new symbols, probably 
    invented for the occasion, a collection for something or other, and the 
    promise of a beer stop, we were OFF! Across the road past an unusual vehicle 
    - a Jaguar bus- and into a low-lying field with a raised path just a tad 
    drier alongside it. The trail crossed various streams, some with steps, and 
    some with stiles in various states of repair. Then past a field of ancient 
    cars, mostly Citroens which must be quite hard to grow in an English 
    climate. Then a narrow path with barbed wire fencing and shiggy and/or 
    puddles underfoot led into a wood where the path was wider but just as damp.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">There were very 
    few checks (or balances) but eventually we arrived at a check near a watch 
    tower. Access to the top platform was prevented by a padlock. Wally resisted 
    all requests to climb there, but nevertheless several young WC's attempted 
    the climb, searching for signs of approaching walkers. Meanwhile their elder 
    brethren attacked the beer store, before the walkers turned up! Amongst 
    these new arrivals, C CHARDONNAY was dismayed to be told by one of the said 
    young WCs that the beer was only for the men! Fortunately, the chocolate 
    bars that were distributed at the same time without sexual or age 
    discrimination. LEGOVER received &nbsp;a chocolate bar described as &quot;Light and 
    Whippy&quot;, which she felt was appropriate.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">After seemingly 
    a long time (everyone got their breath back) to complete these proceedings, 
    we set off again, past another watch tower, this one so rickety in 
    appearance nobody was tempted to climb up it. The trail paths were very wet 
    and slippery, making it quite difficult to walk, and impossible to run. At 
    one point the track was so bad yours truly followed a parallel path in a 
    wood, where the going was not much better; however, there lurking in the 
    shiggy was a GPS Map device. This was either a real trophy or something lost 
    by a hasher; it soon turned out to be the latter, leading to a happy 
    re-union!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">At length we 
    came across a fish-hook sign, and shortly afterwards the trail crossed a 
    main road, then worked round in heathland, which bit yours truly short cut, 
    and then back home via &quot;the measured mile&quot; to the car park.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Fortunately the 
    weather was fine, because there was a long wait for a missing hare as well 
    as lots of missing hounds. Down_Down ceremonies began with two RAs without a 
    single plot; vast quantities of beer or lemonade were&nbsp; poured out by RAs who 
    had no plan for dealing with it. &nbsp;DDs were inflicted randomly on practically 
    everyone present (and by that time the nerves of some intended victims had 
    snapped, and they had already left)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Those <s>caught</s> 
    er rewarded included the Hares DICKHEAD and A N OTHER(s); the RAs 
    themselves; Wally; hash virgins; people peeing behind trees; others 
    snitching on RAs; sinners ignoring fish-hook symbols: a scribe wanting paper 
    (for reasons unspecified), Uncle Tom Cobley, and all. They got beer or 
    lemonade as appropriate. Mercifully when at last all this stuff was 
    exhausted, those hounds who had not already departed made for the Cricketers 
    which although crowded, managed to provide food and drink as required.</p>

    the hash and by the help of HI_HAT, a flour carrier par excellence and 
    apprentice hare who turned up at the last minute to help. There was one 
    hiccup when the hash almost followed the wrong trail but, given the 
    apprentice's advanced age one cannot complain too much. The weather was less

    small parachute early on, apparently designed to lift her out of shiggy and 
    NUTCRACKER, in her eagerness to show off her athletic prowess, managed to 
    trample HEADPLANT. Off we went down road and lane and all was going well 
    until, after a steep hill which seemed to finish everyone the hash picked up 
    the apprentice's mistake. A combination of loud calling and blind panic from 
    the hare soon got everyone back on track. It seems that the large house 
    before the hill was a private school for young ladies. The thought of this 
    crippled DICKHEAD's running for at least three hundred yards.</span></p>

    large field was crossed, with OLD THUMPER trying to hedge her bets so much 
    that she almost ended up in the next county. By a miracle everyone made it 
    to the regroup. From then on it was fairly routine with no one getting lost. 
    The main pack degenerated into two walking/talking/knitting circles with 
    LITTLE PRICK and FULL FRONTAL debating the esoteric problems of raising 
    children and CLOGS and FUKAWI generally talking bollocks. At this point 
    HIPPO was so unimpressed that he took the long walker's route home. The beer 
    stop then ensued, although kept short to avoid dilution in the torrential

    effects of cold weather and rain had probably set in by then. So we reached 
    the end of the hash with one of the hares being approached by PETAL to ask

    presence of Wally whose helpful advice and guidance was an <s>inspiration</s> 
    irritation to us all. Although&nbsp; Tweseldown is an old favourite, YORKIE had

    wondered FLYING DOCTOR), and into Ewshot recreation ground, where several

    were not seen again for several hours. Also, at this point HORN decided to 
    show SMASH his legendary shiggy slinging skills. During the ensuing

    at the Moat car park. HOBBLE arrived munching a HUGE sandwich because he had 
    'only' had a large fried breakfast at noon and his stomach was fading away

    the explosion of pustules on his face were the result of a misspent youth in 
    the Far East (exit females right) while MARY and YORKIE engaged in an in 
    depth debate on their various injuries. It's a wonder MARY is still alive. 
    PONCE then arrived with missus and two beautiful black Labradors. EAT your 
    heart out Schooner for not being there! HANGING ABOUT offered to show 
    everyone a list of the hashes they had done. When it was realised how many

    and NUT into deep water. So much did FRUIT and NUT enjoy this experience 
    that he fell into deep water again a few hundred yards further on, his 
    excuse being that what he though was a bridge was, in fact two logs floating 
    side by side. After these rather traumatic opening few hundred yards things 
    settled down to an even run through good and varying terrain. The only worry 
    during this phase was a strange experience when the author heard HIPPO

    there was a very good turn out on this warm and sunny evening. The start was 
    somewhat difficult to find which led to many hashers arriving at the last 
    minute. This was used as an excuse by SOGGY FRINGE to demonstrate her 
    pathological hate of BMWs when, in spite of a dozen hashers waving and 
    shouting she almost took out a poor woman who was trying to escape from the 
    hash. It was a bad evening also for FLYING DOCTOR who, after early attention 
    was left by SCHOONER for the undoubted attractions of BIDET's and/or PONCE's 
    Alsatian and/or Labrador. Never mind, she at least had the comfort of her 
    packamac, cagoule and primus stove 'in case it got cold later on'. We were

    fields and up hills until we reached the Research Station. Here PETAL was 
    heard to remark that when it's fun it's over very quickly (the hash of 
    course) and MARY bemoaned the fact that the Research Station was a lovely 
    place to work, unlike his day which is spent in stains. The exact nature of 
    said stains was not made clear. It was about this time also that the hares 
    had a falling out. It appears that we ran one loop twice because the 'dim

    on his run(?)in. It was very appropriate for, after his birthday on Saturday 
    several hashers were in need of serious rejuvenation. EVER READY almost took 
    out a 4 by 4 in one of the narrow lanes on the way to the hash and, having 
    arrived was so befuddled that he thought PETAL was much taller than OLD 
    THUMPER, before he realised that he was standing between them on a steep 
    hill. HIPPO, having agreed with HORN that he would lay the downhill parts of 
    the trail while HORN laid the uphill parts, in practice only managed to 
    arrive one check before the end of the trail laying. The incredible excuse 
    was a broken down car!</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">Overall the run was quite uneventful, or was it the eerie 
    silence that comes with partial hangovers? Perhaps it was the exhaustion 
    experienced by most of the pack as we ran straight up what felt like Mount 
    Everest at the start. However the uphill slog was less demanding than on a 
    previous visit because the weather was not as hot. </span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">We followed a squeezed balloon (almost a figure-of-eight) 
    pattern, with the rendezvous near the centre, but the pack was not aware of 
    this because the trail was very undulating and uneven, almost exclusively 
    through woodland. There was the odd bright flash of sun as we emerged at the 
    edge of a field or down a lane. One field was occupied by cows with 
    (non-crumpled) horns, who took little interest in hashing. So desperate for 
    sunlight was YORKIE that at one point he went haring off into a field, only 
    to return to the trail while uttering a long series of curses. Not to be 
    outdone, WET BUSH, in her own inimitable way managed to lead most of the 
    pack astray at one point but a blast on the horn soon got us back on track.

    A small pack assembled at the Odiham Wharf car park, recalling for some an 
    earlier visit when the BBC and heavy rain attended a Deepcut run from the 
    same spot. Mercifully, it was dry on this occasion, but a tad chilly. The 
    Hares warned us about the need to be quiet and polite due to the presence of 
    horses and cows with calves (not the horses) and we set off. The trail led 
    over the canal and passed the Waterwitch Pub and turned right shortly 
    afterwards, through a kissing gate into open fields. The FRB's managed to 
    upset one particular cow at this point. It started bellowing even louder 
    than HIPPO (!) and so frightened us slower mortals that we dared not follow 
    the FRB's, but diverted to avoid an ugly confrontation. We saw at least two 
    calves at the far side of the field, attended by a young mother, so it was 
    presumably granny who saw us off. Silly old MOO.</p>

    &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="NoSpacing" style="line-height: 115%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    The trail crossed various fields, then led past a farmyard with assorted 
    animals including some noisy sheep (not HIPPO challenging) and then into a 
    housing estate. Yours truly followed YORKIE at this point, a big mistake cos 
    we both missed a footpath which led down to the Boosingstoke Canal. By the 
    time yours truly got there the horizon was clear, (clear of hashers, I 
    mean). However a left turn was clearly in order, and a right turn at the 
    main road indicated by flour.</p>

    After some anxious moments I spotted the pack, who must have followed a big 
    loop cos I'd caught up. Across the road near The Jolly Miller Pub and off 
    into country lanes for a bit, eventually rejoining the canal (actually the 
    tow path) which we followed as far as the lifting bridge, where HORN did 
    some trailblazing. Having found the trail, he was about to exercise his 
    instrument when he was confronted by a horse. Not wishing to alarm the 
    animal, HORN apologized profusely and let the pack find their own way. How 
    noble!</p>

    Shortly afterwards we arrived at North Warnborough High Street, hardly the 
    centre of a great metropolis, and turned left to the roundabout, roundabout 
    which the pack turned back. Encouraged by SILVIERFOX, HIPPO and yours truly 
    did not turn back, but took the high road for Odiham, pretending that we 
    would rejoin the trail later. However we managed to find a cunning short cut 
    which avoided the rest of the trail, but fortunately finished in the dreaded 
    car park where NO ENTRY awarded Down downs to:</p>

    A small car park awaited a large number of cars just south of The Hog's 
    Back; where we had a good turn-out for a dullish day. However no cold wind 
    to-day, so the pack set off in high hopes, not dampened by the Hare's 
    intimation that it was a longish run, nor his threat of an indeterminate 
    number of re-groups.</p>

    At least, or rather at first, it was dry but at what felt like three 
    quarter's way round it began to rain, just a few drops, and then stopped, so 
    we thought we were home and dry. But no, steady rain set in for the 
    duration, and worse, we weren't even half way round yet! The sort of 
    warmish, dampish weather when you can sit at home and practically watch the 
    grass grow. But we weren't at home.</p>

    At the start, a short path between high bushes led out from the car park, 
    meeting what appeared to be a newly made broad track beneath some power 
    lines. This led down hill for what seemed like several miles, reaching a 
    check and then proceeding even further. This set the pattern for the run; 
    long stretches with few checks (or balances) so that the FRBs got further 
    and further ahead, except for them what got lost. The trail was a mixture of 
    woodland, with banks of (damp) bluebells, open fields, some with electric 
    fencing, and Lakeland paths.</p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">It was a perfect evening for hashing, sunny but cool, but 
    the tranquillity of the evening was shattered by the arrival of WALLY and 
    the sudden emergence of a decrepit back packer, who turned out to be 
    MOUNTAIN RESCUE. Further unease was caused by KERB CRAWLER's new shorts and 
    the fact that VELCRO M &nbsp;junior was wearing his dad's reins. To cap it all, 
    HOBBLE got into a tugging match over a stick with SCHOONER. The latter won 
    and also almost took parts of HOBBLE's anatomy as well.</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">Off we went into the wide green yonder of Tunnel Hill. 
    After only a short time WET BUSH started stripping but, to all-round 
    disappointment cooled sufficiently at the first check to put her clothes 
    back on. At this point FLYING DOCTOR started a low level muttering of 'how 
    can I get rid of WALLY' that lasted the whole hash, unfortunately without 
    resolution as he was still there at the end, moaning about standards and the 
    lack of calling. On this, I hear that SILVIER FOX, NETTLES and one or two 
    others are to be sent, at hash expense on a three day FRB course. This will 
    teach them how to say 'ON ON' loud enough for others to hear, and for 
    advanced students, how to kick out a circle of flour for others to see. 
    Muttering was also heard from FUKAWI and CLOGS who seemed to be able to keep 
    talking for the whole hash. Finally, at the last regroup FRUIT AND NUT 
    discovered a green TARDIS which turned out to be an Army toilet. He 
    expressed much interest in this because the last time he found one he had 
    entered it only to find a ten pound note on the floor. He explained that, as 
    he bent to pick it up he got a surprise. We stopped his narrative at that 
    point.</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB">It was another of those warm, sultry evenings, but with 
    threatened thunder storms. The pre hash festivities started with NH4's 
    tribute to the Word Cup which, unfortunately came to a premature end when 
    DICKHEAD's perfect overhead bicycle kick led to the ball hitting the 
    windscreen of HAAGENDASH's van. So shocked was SCHOONER that he handed over 
    the driving so that HAAGENDASH could park the van. Through all this, 
    KERBCRAWLER was on a higher intellectual plane whilst discussing Latin 
    grammar with EVER READY. This was good practice as their combined IQ, along 
    with that of the rest of the hash was soon to be severely tested by AQUA and 
    JJ as they explained their new marking system. This had been devised to 
    overcome the fact that another hash had recently used the same area. We soon 
    got into concepts such as single blobs being double blobs and checks being 
    totally different to usual. By the time AQUA had introduced second order 
    differential blobs and tensor calculus blobs most people just wanted to go 
    in the pub and drink themselves into oblivion. Nevertheless, we found the ON 
    and managed to stumble on our way. [It was actually quite simple really; 
    five two-bob cheques plus four half-crown ones to the pound]</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:10.75pt;line-height:115%; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <span lang="EN-GB">The first problem was a field with five exits. This was 
    so large that no one could hear anyone calling. The hares were already 
    starting to panic and led the hash slowly out of its first dilemma (after 3 
    minutes!!). Confidence was further shattered when JJ was heard to say that 
    he didn't know the next part of the trail as AQUA had set it on her own. At 
    one point we became so confused that the hares called everyone back to a 
    check so that we could start all over again. As the run progressed fewer 
    mistakes were made but JJ accused hashers of 'lacking in concentration' on 
    several occasions! It was clear that normality was returning as the usual 
    partner ship of FUKAWI and CLOGS got into one of their long winded 
    discussions; this time something about the difficulty of getting rubber 
    suits off quickly (!). Not to be outdone, PETAL and LEGOVER also got into a 
    long discussion but clammed up every time yours truly came near.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:10.75pt;line-height:115%; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
    <span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Shortly afterwards several runners felt spots of rain 
    which, unfortunately turned out to be drops of sweat from FRUIT and NUT. 
    Shuddering and vomiting were the order of the day. The trail finally came to 
    a check fully furnished with an information board and incomprehensible maps, 
    which restored the confusion. HAMLET appeared from nowhere, refused to join 
    the SCBs, and disappeared only to return later with the FRB pack! The SCBs 
    had been waiting for ages for this reunion, but had failed to find the ON. 
    PRIMATE and FLYING DOCTOR were instructed to make their way towards a wooden 
    shed where they would be met by the rest of the hash. They were not seen 
    again until well after the end of the hash. I refuse to draw any conclusions 
    from this episode.</span></p>

    park as usual was a tad crowded not only with NH4 cars, but also a couple of 
    soldiers' cars whose owners were driven off by FRUITnNUT's commands, or 
    perhaps by his recruiting efforts. We thought maybe they had taken revenge 
    by denting JGG's car, but it turned out the damage had been inflicted by 
    French (possibly targeted) hailstones. But I digress....</span></p>

    and did not emerge until about the half hour mark (well , for yours truly), 
    eventually crossing the road towards long valley. Here, we followed the 
    southern edge for a while eventually leaving trees and having fine views 
    across the valley. The FRBs disappeared down steep tracks to the valley 
    floor, but the Hares advised the rearguard (ie yours truly plus the usual 
    suspects) not to lose height, so we didn't.</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">A perfect hashing 
    evening attracted a good turnout. Even SUGAR PLUM FAIRY appeared, albeit for 
    a short time; hopefully we'll see more of him soon. FRUIT and NUT was 
    indulging in his favourite hobby of 'telling young women about hashing'. The 
    ladies in question were in a car and, being sensible they kept moving, but 
    this did not deter him! By this time the circle had become a rabble with 
    various elements of the knitting circle forming chatting groups. Finally, NO 
    ENTRY imposed severe discipline and set us on our way.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">The first few 
    hundred yards were like the Lord of the Rings with dappled sunshine and low 
    hanging vines. Several hashers thought they had sighted an Orc but it turned 
    out to be BIDET on a bad day. At this point the hash slowed considerably. 
    Was this due to the very short, tight white skirt FUGGLES was wearing? It 
    was obviously causing the sap to rise in the old and gnarled trees because 
    PRIMATE was heard to make a suggestion to her at a kissing gate. This had 
    such an impact on him that, while passing a road named 'Portsmouth Close' he 
    consulted his trusty GPS and announced that Portsmouth was, in fact miles 
    away.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Portsmouth not so 
    Close was passed after a circuitous route around the Alton Rehab centre, 
    which set one or two pacemakers racing ahead, out into an open field where 
    exposure to the sun threatened trouble. This danger was averted, however, by 
    diverting through woods, giving shade from the sun and from satellites (GPS 
    unhappy). Celestial guidance was not necessary as it turned out, because NO 
    ENTRY took pity on the SCBs and brought us home over the A31, helpfully half 
    closed off by road works signs (no signs of actual works!) and back into the 
    delights of Chawton (actually of Greyfriars). </span></p>

    attracted a reboot from DICKHEAD and SYLVIA found something that was a 
    billion years old and unique. No, not FRUIT and NUT, who collared said 
    object, a flint, for his extensive rock collection (he really does have a

    2.25 hours visions of a relaxed day evaporated.&nbsp; This did not faze DOUBLE

    the hares at this point. Next, a new hash milestone was achieved as MARY and 
    KARL MARX were both injured, at the same place at the same time and whinged 
    in unison! On we plodded with the incessant sun beating down on us, being 
    ambushed by devious gorse bushes and gradually succumbing to dehydration. 
    Even the spotter plane sent out to find us brought no relief. Finally, we 
    made the cider stop which was good, but many hashers subsequently fell 
    victim to the dreaded gas-at-both-ends syndrome. Things were summed up by a

    some of the older hashers but were told that there were too few moving parts 
    left to make it worthwhile. The next panorama proved to be the quarry. Given 
    the state of CHARDONNEY the previous night it was christened the stoned

    was pointed out that they were large, irregular boulders <i>a long way away</i>. 
    Her state of confusion could have been caused by the dreamy blue tutu being

    Yateley Common. An unaccompanied Mette (sounds like some form of a capella 
    musical arrangement) arrived alone having told HORN to get on his bike. 
    Talking of transport, poor Robert was being harangued in two languages to 
    let go his car. This top man refused point blank, just like any bloke when 
    it comes to cars. The hares then explained their cunning new trail marking 
    arrangements with a clarity that rivalled the logic of St Thomas Aquinas, 
    and off we went. The well but frugally marked trail essentially went W 
    parallel to the A30, looped N and then returned parallel to the out-trail, 
    but there were diversions along the way to cover up the plot.</span></p>

    and there were dark mutterings about Berkshire hash. NETTLES was seen to 
    stand on what he thought was a regroup as everyone filed past at great 
    speed. After about a minute, which is the average speed of messages along 
    his neural pathways he finally remembered the hare's explanation and 
    followed on. We were getting the hang of it when EVER READY jumped over a 
    fisherman's pole and nearly kicked his rod(!?). Things were about to get 
    serious when SCHOONER arrived on the scene and scared off the fisherman. 
    Poor SCHOONER, seriously injured at both ends. When asked if it hurt, HAAGEN 
    DASH explained that it did, but not as much as the vet's injuries! Things, 
    or rather lack of things must still have been sore because SCHOONER 
    immediately jumped into the lake to cool off, closely followed by FLYING 
    DOCTOR (what is it about those two?). The water was so dirty that divine 
    inspiration would not have been needed to walk on it but, after shaking 
    herself dry, FLYING DOCTOR seemed no worse for the experience. However, she 
    was suddenly seen to be front running for at least half a mile; must have 
    been some good stuff in that lake, probably testosterone leaking from 
    SCHOONER. At this point NON STICK slipped into the water. He explained that 
    it shouldn't have happened as he knew the trail. To many this seemed like a

    evening saw a good turnout for one of OLD THUMPER's and JOLLY GREEN GIANT's 
    legendary runs. It was thought that arrival of flowers and presents heralded 
    a service of thanksgiving and sacrifice to these two giants of hashing but, 
    in the event it was only to celebrate OLD THUMPER's (indeterminate) 
    birthday. The general festivities were brought to an abrupt end with the 
    arrival of CUNNINGLINGUS, another of the WALLY, Berkshire mould who 
    proceeded to moan about the location, the map and just about everything 
    else. This had a strange effect on BIDET who started murmuring about urine 
    and thrushes (see BIDET for further clarification). After finally getting 
    the circle together, in spite of FUGGLES's continual nattering, we set off.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The first few minutes were total 
    confusion as the flour took us over, through and around the village green. 
    In fact, this continued for some time, with certain tell tale signs of 
    exasperation on the part of the hares. Finally, all became clear and the 
    hash settled down to an interesting run. After about a mile, CUNNINGLINGUS 
    started up again. His encyclopaedic knowledge of the area was only matched 
    by his continual ability to get lost and his deep understanding of the 
    esoteric hand signals used by Berkshire. One must admire the public spirited 
    way in which the Berkshire hash take in damaged individuals like 
    CUNNINGLINGUS and WALLY, who must have suffered severe oxygen starvation at 
    birth. All this continued to have an odd effect on BIDET as he mused on how 
    the fields were soft and yielding and ideal for falling on top of and, later 
    at the pub, his comments on the firm, ripe and plump blackberries. What was 
    he thinking about? </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The remainder of the hash was 
    fairly uneventful save for one unusual feature. No matter how many times the 
    pack overtook WHALE they found him ahead at the next bend. At first, it was 
    thought that WHALE had gained access to a matter transporter but it was soon 
    realised that all the warp drive, impulse drive and phaser power of the 
    Enterprise put together would be insufficient to move such a mass. The 
    mystery deepened further when DICKHEAD discovered a metal gate with a huge 
    dent in it. Was this where the transporter finally gave up the ghost? In 
    honour of his discovery DICKHEAD named the area WHALE Lane. OS maps will be 
    updated through the usual channels. </p>

    from (and I mean dug them up) is a mystery. After finally getting served the 
    hash retired to the garden for a well earned rest. There being no members of 
    mismanagement present, no down downs were awarded. </p>

    humid and rain threatened evening in Rotherwick as 30 or so hashers gathered 
    for their weekly torture. To lift the gloom, HOBBLE turned up with GEORGE, a 
    cool blonde with deep brown affectionate eyes and winning ways, but also 
    unfortunately with four legs. FULL FRONTAL also turned up with a friend, to 
    whom FRUIT and NUT gave the full hash history, with the usual effect. At 
    least she finished the run! The locals were less accommodating as they 
    viewed FLYING DOCTOR laughing uproariously while brushing a white powder off 
    her face and nose. Happily, the expected visit from the boys in blue didn't 
    materialise. She was also in deep conversation with NO ENTRY and KERB 
    CRAWLER about slowly unwrapping a large cucumber whilst laying the trail. 
    (No comment).</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The off was far 
    from successful. We immediately found the ON INN, which encouraged some 
    people to head straight for the pub. This was followed by what seemed like a 
    half marathon of tarmac but, finally we found trees and fields. The route 
    was varied, but with several long straight stretches which suited the 
    runners in the pack but challenged those of more mature years. All three 
    hares were models of tight lipped, remote rectitude when asked for clues. 
    Was it pure strength of character or had they simply forgotten the way? Any 
    exhaustion was, fortunately alleviated by snatches of unusual conversations: 
    FULL FRONTAL 'a small one now and then is quite nice'; CLOGGS 'I like to 
    vary my stroke now and again' and AQUA 'I like a good length and that was 
    one'. If, dear reader you can put these quotes into context your authors 
    would be eternally grateful. It was noted that whatever the stroke was, 
    CLOGGS ran like a true athlete throughout the hash. Perhaps we all need 
    some.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">WHALE and 
    PRIMATE missed all these conversational gems as they were boldly going where 
    no other hound would go (since it was off-piste, or should it be piste-off?). 
    By the time they arrived at the main entrance to Tylney Hall, the trusty GPS 
    indicated that the route home went through the grounds there. Fearful lest 
    they be arrested, plastered with golf balls, or just forced to scale a wall 
    to get out, they finally emerged unscathed at the golf club entrance, to 
    find flour! Not clear whether it was the IN- or OUT-trail but it led shortly 
    to the ON_INN well before the FRBs returned.</p>

    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>A wonderful autumn day saw a lowish turnout for what proved to be a very 
    good hash. As usual, FRUIT and NUT got hopelessly lost and was seen lifting 
    barriers( though he failed to raise the fallen tree), reversing and passing 
    the car park several times before finally finding the start. In parallel 
    MARY regaled the assembled throng with horror stories of his injured knee 
    and the operation to come and PRIME 8 walked around with a fixed grin, 
    having escaped the stress of preparing for KILLER GENE'S birthday. The main 
    shock of the day was that CENTRE OF ATTRACION was on time! All this was 
    accompanied by a continuous high pitch yell from Toby that continued 
    throughout the first half of the run as a form a homing beacon for the lost 
    and bewildered. As NO ENTRY pointed out, the rave reviews had started early!
    </p>
    <p>The first check was the kind most hashers like, 5 yds from the car park. 
    Thereafter they became increasingly wide apart and separated by large hills. 
    At an early check it was noticed that DICKHEAD had dark brown stains on his 
    socks. Shiggy? No, instead a somewhat rapid ablution before he left home 
    that morning. The run was proceeding smoothly when suddenly, for no apparent 
    reason GOLDEN BALLS started muttering about the tail and set off on his own. 
    This caused consternation and about 5 minutes confusion as the hash 
    scattered in all directions. Thankfully, KERB CRAWLER got us back on track. 
    GOLDEN BALLS was not seen again, other than emerging from the woods to stand 
    on corners with a strangely disturbed look on his face. More trouble was to 
    come. The hare informed us to be careful as there were fox holes ahead. 
    FRUIT and NUT immediately wanted to return to the start to load up with 
    grenades and flame throwers. A quick dose of his medication and all was well 
    again. Medication again came to mind when word came back that someone had 
    squashed OLD THUMPER'S blobs. Expecting to see the mangled remains of the 
    local flasher we were relieved to find it was only her flour that had been 
    interfered with. It was about this time also that two unknown women started 
    to track us and follow us back to the on in. Hash men really are 
    irresistible!! </p>
    <p>The pack then sneaked off to the garden of the ON_INN where there were 
    seats, and eats available. It came as a shock to interrupt these pleasures 
    to procedd to next business ie Down-Downs. However, after some discussion of 
    OLD THUMPER'S spanking laces (!) these were awarded to: </p>
    <p>OLD THUMPER and JGG for a great trail. </p>
    <p>LUCY and friend for being late after mixing up the post code with the map 
    reference. </p>
    <p>MARY and CAROLINE who, as the walking party had to be told the way by 
    TOBY. </p>
    <p>And for TOBY, the hash navigator. </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Today was 
    probably the best hashing day for months with a clear blue sky and cool 
    weather. With a good turnout all looked good. Before the off EVER READY had 
    the unfortunate experience of realising he had forgotten to put on his 
    shorts and so had to run in jog bottoms. The appearance of a policewoman was 
    thought to have something to do with his lack of cover until it became clear 
    that the yellow jacketed cyclist was, in fact FLYING DOCTOR, in Chris Hoye 
    mode. Today was also the day that VELCRO junior discovered that dogs have 
    tails. Unfortunately, the dog involved was Schooner. Luckily several people 
    pounced just in time before small boy became an even smaller breakfast for 
    large dog. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The off was 
    uneventful, other than waking the good people of Holybourne from their 
    Saturday night stupors. The trail then became one very long hill. Half way 
    up we were passed by a tractor with an unfriendly looking driver who 
    immedialty got onto his mobile phone. Within minutes were stopped by a land 
    rover driven by an irate local gamekeeper. I was expecting him to get out 
    his shotgun but, instead he blasted SILVIA with some home truths about game 
    rearing. Even the collective charms of the hash ladies made no difference 
    and we were obliged to make a great deal of use of the local roads.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">On and on we 
    plodded until it felt as though we had entered a half marathon. Very little 
    of note occurred except, coming upon NO ENTRY who was very slow today we 
    noticed that he had a snail trail behind him. There's slow and slow! In 
    fact, the trail was caused by Toby who was suffering from a very runny nose.</p>
